# ML-TAO-npjDM

Five python codes (to build ML models predicting each inflammatory sign) and sample data (images and labels)
Each code generates .xlsx files which contain prediction results.
Additional codes will be needed to calculate CAS (Clinical Activity Score) and to measure the performance of each model or whole system.

## sample_data/
### Redness_of_eyelids/
Cropped images each containing eyelid
The photos with left eye are flipped horizontally to look like right eye.

### Redness_of_conjunctiva/
#### medial
Cropped images each containing medial canthus
The photos with left eye are flipped horizontally to look like right eye.

#### lateral
Cropped images each containing lateral canthus
The photos with left eye are flipped horizontally to look like right eye.

### Swelling_of_eyelids/
Cropped images each containing eyelid
The photos with left eye are flipped horizontally to look like right eye.

### Inflammation_of_caruncle/
Cropped images each containing medial canthus
The photos with left eye are flipped horizontally to look like right eye.

### Conjunctival_edema/
Cropped images each containing lateral canthus
The photos with left eye are flipped horizontally to look like right eye.
